This [project](https://johnpaulinepineda.github.io/Portfolio_Project_51/) implements various predictive modelling procedures for right-censored time-to-event responses. Models applied in the analysis to estimate survival risk scores included the Cox Proportional Hazards Regression, Cox Net Survival, Survival Trees, Random Survival Forest and Gradient Boosted Survival algorithms. The resulting predictions derived from the candidate models were evaluated in terms of their discrimination power using the concordance index metric. The differences in survival probabilities for different risk groups were additionally examined using the Kaplan-Meier survival curves. The survival probability and hazard profiles for sampled individual cases were assessed. Permutation-based and absolute coefficient-based feature importance rankings were determined, as applicable, for model interpretation.
